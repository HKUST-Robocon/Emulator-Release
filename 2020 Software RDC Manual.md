## Objective

* The objective of the RDC is to assess:
	* How well you **cooperate** with each other.
	* Your **knowledge**/skillset and **attitude** towards learning.
	* How well you take **initiative** and **self-learn**.

## Game Rules

* A game will be simulated on the Emulator and should take at most 3 minutes.
* Each team controls one robot. This robot must perform the tasks stated.
* Teams will have access to motors and sensors. These are restricted to a set agreed with other divisions (Mech + HW).
* Obstacles will be randomly generated in the field.

## Game Tasks

### Field Tasks: The stuff common to Mech, HW, and SW

* Move the robot
* Avoid obstacles
* Grab balls from the appropriate basket
	* Tennis ball
	* Ping-pong ball
* Place 3 ping-pong balls into each placing-basket
* Grab placing-baskets
* Place placing-baskets on rack
* Shoot tennis balls to conversion post on the other side of the field

### Software Tasks

* Code will be simulated through the Emulator.
* Code may be split into multiple files.
* The wheelbase is comprised of two forward wheels and an universal wheel at the back.

## Other Rules

### Submission

* Your code should be uploaded onto a private repo and that repo should be shared with your mentor and seniors.
* Any motors and sensors used will be cross-checked.

### Disqualifications

A team is disqualified if:

* Code is plagiarised. We encourage sharing ideas/concepts across teams, but code plagiarism is a no-no.
* They fail to provide/submit their code on time.
* The code submitted performs malicious behaviour (e.g. modifies OS, connects to network, installs virus). Saving/reading Emulator-related files is OK.


## Evaluation

In order to give equal weight to a team's *score* and *time*, teams will be assessed based on several criteria. These are:

1. **score gained** in the simulation,
2. **time taken** to complete tasks, and
3. **teamwork**.

Each criteria is marked out of 10, for a total 30.

Score and time will be marked based on specific objectives met. Teamwork will be marked by mentor(s) and through peer evaluation.

Scoring for *score* and *time* has not been determined yet.
